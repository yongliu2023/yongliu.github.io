    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> More than a decade ago, the Chinese government created several agricultural programs with the objective to promote food security and to foster environmental sustainability via the adoption of more eco-conscious practices in agriculture. While the overall application rate of chemical fertilizer has significantly declined, the adoption of low-carbon technologies promoted through these initiatives remains relative low—partly due to the lack of a wide-reaching systems to implement the recommended practices and farmers' lack of awareness and knowledge about the technologies. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of technical training on low-carbon management practices, specifically on the adoption of soil testing and formulated fertilization technologies. We hypothesize that technical training and education facilitates the adoption of promoted technologies. Data for this research come from a random sample of 1115 rice farmers in Hubei, China. Using a logistic regression, we empirically examine the effect of having received formal technical training within the last 12 months on the likelihood of adopting low-carbon technologies. To account for potential heterogeneity and selection bias, we employ counterfactual framework and propensity score matching and estimate the average treatment effect for those who have received formal technical training. Our results revealed a positive and significant association between formal technical training and rice farmers’ adoption of low-carbon technologies, with an average treatment effect of 0.2078. Males, younger farmers, and members of agricultural cooperatives were more likely to adopt soil testing and formulated fertilization technologies. Further, a gender analysis, conducted only with those who indicated having received technical training on low-carbon technologies, showed that trained females were more prone to adopt these technologies than trained males. Our findings provide and discuss meaningful implications for the development of future efforts to promote the adoption of low-carbon agricultural technologies in China. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This study examined the relationship between the adoption of Climate-Smart soil management practices and climate resilience. We hypothesized that the adoption of soil testing and formulated fertilization positively impact farmers’ ability to absorb and recover from climate-related shocks and stresses. Data for this study came from a random sample of 753 rice farmers in Hubei, China. We used three indicators as proxies for economic climate resilience: net agricultural income, rice yield, and rice productivity. We explored the determinants of adopting soil testing and formulated fertilizer and climate resilience for rice farmers via Probit regression and Ordinary Least Squares regression. In addition, we performed Endogenous Switching regression to address the potential selection bias of farmers’ decisions on soil nutrient management and endogeneity. Our results showed that younger, those with higher levels of education and large-scale farmers were more likely to adopt the soil testing and formulated fertilization technology. Our study provides evidence that the adoption of soil testing and formulated fertilization significantly enhanced rice climate resilience. Particularly, the adoption of soil nutrient management technologies increased net agricultural income, rice yield, and productivity, with estimated causal effects of 5.63% (p<0.01), 4.44% (p<0.01), and 2.84% (p<0.05), respectively. Our findings provide further insight into the role and importance of soil nutrient management in promoting climate resilience in China.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> This study aims to explore gender-based differences in financial socialization and their effects on financial knowledge in Turkey—a nation that provides a distinctive case study since it combines economic modernization with a strong adherence to traditional gender role beliefs. We used the Social Learning Theory and Social Role Theory as guiding frameworks for this cross-sectional study.  The sample of the study consisted 513 adult participants. About half (50.7%) of the sample was composed of female respondents, and the average age of respondents in the total sample was 31.2 years old (SD=12.09). Our results indicated that financial knowledge levels remain low in Turkey. Despite the implementation of recent national financial education programs, a gender gap in financial knowledge exists, where Turkish women are more disadvantaged in terms of financial knowledge. Mothers and siblings are influential role models and source of financial knowledge for female respondents well into adulthood, more so than males. Irrespective of gender, parental direct teaching  is a catalyst for increased levels of financial knowledge. On the other hand, parental role modeling  is associated with lower levels of financial knowledge, even when controlling for socio-demographic variables. Our findings shed light on relevant aspects to be considered when developing financial literacy programs and interventions that may potentially improve the national financial.</p></div>
